Open source code for "CUP: Comprehensive User-Space Protection for C/C++" AsiaCCS '18.

I am currently working to clean up the private working repository and push a somewhat sane
version here.  This code will be a very preliminary prototype.  A cleaner reimplementation that 
does not rely on analyzing IR to find pointer dereferences is in progress, but I have no
estimate as to when it will be finished, it is a side project.
